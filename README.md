# SnakeInC

Update: 6/15/2024

My first and most recent commit for this project was on July 26th, 2023. I didn't understand how to use Git back then, so I did not regularly commit my changes.
I also did not know how to correctly use Makefiles to compile this program, so I relied on Visual Studio's (not VSCode) compiler to sort that out for me.

Now that I am learning how to create and run Makefiles, I am restructuring this whole project so that it is not reliant on Visual Studio.
I will likely be making more changes to it as well, so Git will be used more frequently to track my progress.
